# odin_recipes
The Odin Project's first project: making a basic recipe website.

README! 
    THIS IS GOING TO BE MY FIRST SOLO PROJECT. I AM GOING TO BE ATTEMPTING THIS WITH AS
    LITTLE GUIDANCE AS POSSIBLE. ONCE DONE, THIS WILL BE A GOOD INDICATOR OF HOW FAST I COULD 
    PROGRESS THROUGH THE ODIN PROJECT.

    HERE GOES EVERYTHING!

Some skills I will have demonstrated by the end of the project:
<ol>
    <li>create an html file with the proper boiler plate layout</li>
    <li>using git commands to track my version history</li>
    <li>creating links to different pages within my webpage</li>
    <li>adding images properly to my webpages</li>
    <li>managing my repository on GitHub</li>
</ol>
This webpage is going to have a home page which links to each of the recipes. Each recipe page will also include a link back to the home page. I plan on having three recipes:
Shepherd's Pie
Mashed Potatoes
Chocolate Chip Cookies

Progress update! I have accomplished all of the goals I had set out to achieve with my current layout. I will now be working on refining my CSS skills and polishing the webpage.

My goal for the webpage is to have a column on the left with the recipes linked (with photos) and have the content all displayed in the center. The center content will be able to scroll without the recipe link column moving.
