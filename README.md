# odin_recipes
The Odin Project's first project: making a basic recipe website.

README! 
    THIS IS GOING TO BE MY FIRST SOLO PROJECT. I AM GOING TO BE ATTEMPTING THIS WITH AS
    LITTLE GUIDANCE AS POSSIBLE. ONCE DONE, THIS WILL BE A GOOD INDICATOR OF HOW FAST I COULD 
    PROGRESS THROUGH THE ODIN PROJECT.

    HERE GOES EVERYTHING!

Some skills I will have demonstrated by the end of the project:
<ol>
    <li>create an html file with the proper boiler plate layout</li>
    <li>using git commands to track my version history</li>
    <li>creating links to different pages within my webpage</li>
    <li>adding images properly to my webpages</li>
    <li>managing my repository on GitHub</li>
</ol>
