    <h3>What it's about:</h3>
    <p>Shepherd's pie has got to be one of my favorite comfort foods. There's just something so great about a simple dish containing just the necessary components; nothing overly fancy needed for a good shepherd's pie (although there are some pretty pretentious recipes out there).
    </p>
    <h3>What's in it:</h3>
    <p>Here's what you'll need to get started:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of ground beef (as lean as you can get)</li>
        <li>2 cups of <a href="../recipes/mashed-potatoes.html">mashed potatoes</a> (if you can't make beautiful scratch-built potatoes, store-bought is fine)</li>
        <li>1 cup of diced carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup of peas (frozen is fine)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons of ground pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic powder (just a suggestion, you measure that shit with your heart)</li>
        <li>1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese (optional topping)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of chives (optional topping)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What you need to do:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Cook your mashed potatoes</h4>

        <p>If you've got the time, I highly recommend making <a href="./mashed-potatoes.html">these mashed potatoes</a>. This can be a tall order, so store-bought is fine as well. Just whip them up by the instructions on the box and set them aside. Don't worry about them cooling, you're going to be baking that shit right back up in a bit.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Cook your ground beef</h4>

        <p>Cook your ground beef over medium-high heat, draining the grease when done. </p></li>
